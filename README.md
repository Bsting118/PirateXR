# About
Unity project called "Pirate XR" that was made for my CS-420 virtual reality class at Kettering University. 
Developed alongside a group of three classmates that served as the project's dev team: myself, Zach Freytag, and Matthew Herber. 

In this game, you play as a pirate in VR and try to shoot as many targets with your ship's cannons as quickly as possible
within a given time limit. Use your VR controllers to teleport/traverse the ship's deck, control the cannons, and steer the ship!

Also, here's an early screenshot of the game taken while playing it in an Oculus Quest 2 headset:

# To Download
In order to work with this Unity project, please ensure you have Unity ver. 2022.3.4f1 installed locally. The XR Interaction Toolkit is also required for this project to run, 
so if there are any errors related to the XR plugin, be sure to get it from the Unity Package Manager or the Unity Asset Store. Regardless, it should still be included with the clone.

Once cloned, go into Unity Hub and add the project from DISK. Ensure the project's Unity version is set to '2022.3.4f1' mentioned previously. 
Afterwards, the project should take a bit to compile and then you can test/work with it from there.
